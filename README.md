# 📈 Stock Trend Analysis using LSTM and Flask

This project is a web-based stock price prediction app that uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast the next day's stock closing price. The user can input any valid stock ticker (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`) and view predictions along with a plot of past and predicted prices.
